#todo.py because I forget shit.


'''
Note to self:
        I already have a class that opens a new window incase there is some need for cooky UI shit.
         
        
I just use the IP planner itself to use todo now this is outdated.


Change all the moves because cross platform it will blow ass


AttributeError: 'Main_Screen' object has no attribute 'sub_project_counter'
	when you click new sub project imediately	
	its because it immediately goes to add_subproject and subproject counter is not	initialiezd.
	when u reintialize this counter is at 1  not 3.

the position of X sucks. it goes up or down make it relative to the label itself somehow get the labels pos and add it.
	this is easy.

connect the button to something.
