'''
1. Fix alignment on button text.
2. Make it so it happens on the same screen.

3. Button text truncates.


4. You can revert all the buttons/data that the screen initliazed with QSettings from HKEY.
    Anything that is dynamically made must be done in a slightly more weirder way, with Project-Manager
    OR
    You could in the clicked connect merely output a file with number of buttons made, the positions, etc. and just
    add them and give them settings.
    OR
    The settings remembers the last dynamically made widget so perhaps thats not super scalable.
    Or you could just give it unique text, positions the rest is just simple pushing up right?
