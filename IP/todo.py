#todo.py because I forget shit.


'''
Note to self:
        I already have a class that opens a new window incase there is some need for cooky UI shit.
        


1. Fix alignment on button text.
2. Make it so it happens on the same screen.

3. Button text truncates.


4. not having layout in gui is not an issue because the default widgets are basically nothing.
    In terms of basic class templates that works too, most data is passed safely i think.
