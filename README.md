I use this as well, because it's quite easy to have a thousand apps on your PC now-a-days, so word/wordpad/whatever is out.  \
It's very easy to write things on paper and have your dog eat your "homework" or cat or whatever.                             \
INotes or reminders remains a last choice. But when was the last time you had a thousand notes and a thousand reminders?      \

Having a more compact way to see things, with LIMITED/minimal amount of features, forces you to be smart and this is a really smart to-do list.\
I got the idea from a Professor at my University.
