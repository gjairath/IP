            This time with more documentation, better file structure and less de-duplication.


I will be following this for file-structure that doesn't suck:
        README.rst
        LICENSE
        setup.py
        requirements.txt
        sample/__init__.py
        sample/core.py
        sample/helpers.py
        docs/conf.py
        docs/index.rst
        tests/test_basic.py
        tests/test_advanced.py
